"A Machine Learning Based Analytical Framework for Semantic Annotation
  Requirements","[u'Hamed Hassanzadeh', u'MohammadReza Keyvanpour']","International Journal of Web & Semantic Technology (IJWesT), Vol.
  2, No. 2, pp. 27-38, Aprill 2011",0.3360969272762574,"  The Semantic Web is an extension of the current web in which information is
given well-defined meaning. The perspective of Semantic Web is to promote the
quality and intelligence of the current web by changing its contents into
machine understandable form. Therefore, semantic level information is one of
the cornerstones of the Semantic Web. The process of adding semantic metadata
to web resources is called Semantic Annotation. There are many obstacles
against the Semantic Annotation, such as multilinguality, scalability, and
issues which are related to diversity and inconsistency in content of different
web pages. Due to the wide range of domains and the dynamic environments that
the Semantic Annotation systems must be performed on, the problem of automating
annotation process is one of the significant challenges in this domain. To
overcome this problem, different machine learning approaches such as supervised
learning, unsupervised learning and more recent ones like, semi-supervised
learning and active learning have been utilized. In this paper we present an
inclusive layered classification of Semantic Annotation challenges and discuss
the most important issues in this field. Also, we review and analyze machine
learning applications for solving semantic annotation problems. For this goal,
the article tries to closely study and categorize related researches for better
understanding and to reach a framework that can map machine learning techniques
into the Semantic Annotation challenges and requirements.

Engineering Semantic Web Applications by Using Object-Oriented Paradigm,"[u'Amjad Farooq', u'Syed Ahsan', u'Abad Shah']","Journal of Computing, Vol. 2, No. 6, June 2010, NY, USA, ISSN
  2151-9617",0.3360969272762574,"  The web information resources are growing explosively in number and volume.
Now to retrieve relevant data from web has become very difficult and
time-consuming. Semantic Web envisions that these web resources should be
developed in machine-processable way in order to handle irrelevancy and manual
processing problems. Whereas, the Semantic Web is an extension of current web,
in which web resources are equipped with formal semantics about their
interpretation through machines. These web resources are usually contained in
web applications and systems, and their formal semantics are normally
represented in the form of web-ontologies. In this research paper, an
object-oriented design methodology (OODM) is upgraded for developing semantic
web applications. OODM has been developed for designing of web applications for
the current web. This methodology is good enough to develop web applications.
It also provides a systematic approach for the web applications development but
it is not helpful in generating machine-pocessable content of web applications
in their development. Therefore, this methodology needs to be extended. In this
paper, we propose that extension in OODM. This new extended version is referred
to as the semantic web object-oriented design methodology (SW-OODM).
